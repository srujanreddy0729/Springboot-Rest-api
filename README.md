# Spring Boot project uses REST-API
In this project, I developed a Spring Boot application to provide a REST API for managing JobPosts. 
The API supports full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on [insert entity, e.g., 'JobPosts'].
The project is structured with a layered architecture, ensuring clear separation between the controller, service, repository and data access layers. 
I utilized Linked List to perform CRUD Operations handling data persistence seamlessly.

For testing and interacting with the API, I used Postman. This involved creating various HTTP requests to endpoints to perform CRUD operations, 
such as sending POST requests to create new records, GET requests to retrieve data, PUT requests to update existing records, and DELETE requests to remove records.

Additionally, I implemented input validation and comprehensive error handling within the API, ensuring that only valid data is processed and that meaningful error messages are returned. 
This project demonstrated the full lifecycle of RESTful API development, from design and implementation to testing and validation.
